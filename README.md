# SD-DINO Features

This is a fork of the original [SD-DINO repository](https://github.com/Junyi42/sd-dino) and optimized for the use case of the NOM-Diffusion pipeline.

This repository is part of the Master's Thesis, "6D Object Pose Estimation Using Diffusion Models" by Simon Schl√§pfer at the Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH Zurich, in collaboration with Google Research, autumn 2024.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/simonschlaepfer/sd-dino.git
cd SD-DINO
```

Then, follow the installation guide of the original repository.

## Usage

This repository is modified to get easier function calls when running the [NOM-Diffusion](https://github.com/Calimero/NOM-Diffusion) pipeline. It serves as base when computing the DINOv2 features which are used as conditionings during the diffusion process.
